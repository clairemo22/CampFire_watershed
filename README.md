This project was done for a Data Science class prject in Spring 2022 in collaboration with Lauren Magliozzi. 

The Camp Fire data is hers and thus far unpublished, so the code is made available here but the data will remain private. 

The precipitation data is publiclly available and can be pulled from (https://cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/req/CSVDataServlet?Stations=PDE&SensorNums=45&dur_code=D&Start=2018-01-11&End=2019-05-31) as in the code.
